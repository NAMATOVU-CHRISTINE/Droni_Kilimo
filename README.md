# Droni_Kilimo

"Let's make it rain" — Droni_Kilimo is a drone-assisted precision irrigation prototype for smallholder farms. The project combines aerial data (drone imagery + sensors) with automated irrigation control to optimize water use, detect stressed areas, and schedule targeted watering.

> Note: This README is a living document. Replace placeholders below with project-specific commands, API endpoints, or hardware details as you finalize implementation.

## Goals
- Reduce water waste by delivering irrigation only where and when needed.
- Provide farmers with actionable insights from aerial imagery (crop stress, pest/disease hotspots, moisture variability).
- Automate irrigation control for target zones using drone- and ground-sensor-derived metrics.

## Key features
- Collect aerial imagery and sensor telemetry from drones.
- Process images to produce vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) and moisture maps.
- Zone-based irrigation recommendations.
- Web dashboard (or CLI) to view maps, schedules, and logs.
- Integration with irrigation controllers/valves (simulated or real hardware).

## Architecture overview
Typical components:
- Drone image capture (field flight paths) and telemetry uploader.
- Image processing pipeline (orthomosaic generation, indexing, classification).
- Backend service that stores processed maps and produces irrigation recommendations.
- Optional hardware integration module to send commands to irrigation valves.
- Frontend dashboard to visualize fields, zones, and irrigation history.

(Adapt architecture diagrams and component details to your implementation.)

## Getting started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (or Node.js 14+ if using JS stack) — update to match the repo stack
- Docker (optional, recommended for reproducible deployments)
- Drone hardware or sample imagery for testing (GeoTIFF / JPG + geojson)
- (Optional) Valve controller / MQTT broker for real hardware integrations

### Install (example for Python-based project)
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/NAMATOVU-CHRISTINE/Droni_Kilimo.git
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

If the project uses Node:
   npm install

If using Docker:
   docker-compose up --build

### Configuration
Create a .env file or update config.yaml with:
- DATABASE_URL (e.g., sqlite:///data.db or Postgres URL)
- STORAGE_PATH (where uploads and generated maps are stored)
- MQTT_BROKER / VALVE_CONTROLLER_ENDPOINT (if integrating hardware)
- MAP_PROCESSING_THREADS, IMAGE_TEMP_DIR, etc.

Replace these placeholders with your actual config keys used by the code.

## Usage

### Run locally
- Start backend:
  python -m app.main
  OR
  flask run
  OR
  npm run dev

- Start frontend (if present):
  cd frontend
  npm start

- Upload imagery:
  Use the provided upload endpoint (e.g., POST /api/uploads) or the CLI uploader script:
  python tools/upload_imagery.py --field-id 1 --files path/to/images/*.jpg

- Trigger processing:
  POST /api/process?field_id=1
  or run the processing worker:
  python workers/process_images.py --field-id 1

Example CLI (replace with your repo's commands):
  ./scripts/run_demo.sh

### Simulate drone flight / demo data
- The repo includes a demo dataset under `data/demo/` (if present). Run:
  python scripts/demo_run.py --demo data/demo/

If there is no demo dataset yet, add sample images and geojsons to `data/demo/` and run the demo script.

## Testing
- Unit tests:
  pytest tests/
- Linting & formatting:
  flake8 .
  black .
- CI:
  Configure GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run tests on push/pull requests.

## Deployment
- Docker image: build and push to your registry
  docker build -t yourorg/droni_kilimo:latest .
  docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... -p 8000:8000 yourorg/droni_kilimo:latest

- Kubernetes: provide manifests or Helm chart to deploy backend, worker, and db.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/my-feature
3. Make changes, add tests.
4. Run tests and linters.
5. Open a Pull Request describing your changes.

Please follow the established code style, write tests for new logic, and keep commits focused.

## Roadmap (suggested)
- Improve image processing pipeline performance.
- Add mobile-friendly farmer dashboard.
- Integrate weather forecast data for irrigation scheduling.
- Support multi-field/farm accounts and role-based access control.
